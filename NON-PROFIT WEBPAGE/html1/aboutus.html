			<center>
			<p style="margin-left:10px">We work with food donors across the country, financial supporters and volunteers to fill unmet needs in Central Texas. This commitment from private, government and charitable partners has allowed us to bring nearly 54 million meals to our community last year and into the hands of families and local nonprofits that turn to us for help. There are three key ways we do this.</br></br>
				1.We share free food and our knowledge on low-cost, healthy eating with families in need. Learn how we stock their shelves, provide healthy meals and educate.</br></br>
				2.We assist families who qualify for federal assistance programs. Learn how we connect families to life-enhancing resources.</br></br>
				3.And finally, we make food affordable for charitable and government partners. The quality food and food resources we provide means that they can spend their limited resources to enhance their programs</br></br>

				We are a registered 501(c)(3), which means that we are not a religious, political or advocacy organization.</br></br>

				We believe there’s strength in numbers and in working together. We are members of Feeding America and Feeding Texas (formerly the Texas Food Bank Network). Our service territory includes: Bastrop, Bell, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, Coryell, Falls, Fayette, Freestone, Gillespie, Hays, Lampasas, Lee, Limestone, Llano, McLennan, Milam, Mills, San Saba, Travis and Williamson counties. Roughly 300 Partner Agencies have joined us to serve families in 21 Central Texas counties at soup kitchens, food pantries, after-school programs, snack programs and other service sites. </br></br>

				A leader in the fight against hunger for nearly 40 years, our mission is to nourish hungry people and lead the community in the fight against hunge</br></br>
